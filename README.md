This is a simplified version of a 6-week team project I had for one of our UnityEngine classes. This was our first multiplayer project and wasn't fully finished on time.

This version has its lobby and connection to a game fully redesigned and the level tilting functionnality removed so that pretty much everything here is from me.
It is definitely an unfinished project that would need a lot of cleaning but also a very good learning experience. Lots of unnecessary dependencies and a few asyncs.
Still a good base or at least a good reference for future projects.

Original project is here:
